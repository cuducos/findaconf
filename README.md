# Find a Conference (WIP)

## About

_Find a Conference_ is under development. This is supposed to be a free, open source and ad-free platform where:

* Registered *users can post info about academic conferences* and call for papers
* Anyone can *register with external accounts* (Google, Facebook, Yahoo etc.) so [we don't have to deal with passwords](http://youtu.be/8ZtInClXe1Q)
* There is *no curatorial layer*, but we should add *report links for users to flag inappropriate and/or duplicated content*
* Only the user *who posted a conference can edit it* 
* The platform should not host too much stuff regarding the conferences: it is *simply a platform for users to find conferences* and then follow to universities web pages, association websites, Eventbrite registrations, planning group emails etc.
* It should be designed to be easily internationalized (*multi-language*)

## Installation

If you want to get a development version of *Find a Conference* running, this session might be helpful. If it is not, let us know.

### Requirements

* Python 2.7+ (but not Python 3)
* PostgreSQL 9.3+
* [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) and [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/) are not required, but are recommended
* [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) is not required, but we are using it in install instructions
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) with [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/)

### Environment variables

This application uses some required *environment variables*. You can copy `.env.sample` as `.env` and customize it. It is the easiest way to set these variables.

#### Databases (required)

* `DATABASE_URL`: URL and credentials to development database (e.g. `postgres://vagrant:vagrant@localhost/findaconf`)  
* `DATABASE_URL_TEST`: URL and credentials to test database (e.g. `postgres://vagrant:vagrant@localhost/findaconf_test`)  

#### Security (required)

* `SECRET_KEY`: [Flask's default secret key](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.Flask.secret_key)

#### Public APIs (recommended)

* `GOOGLE_PUBLIC_API`: credentials to [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/)
* `GOOGLE_PLACES_PROXY` *(optional)*: if you want to [access Google Places API through a proxy](contrib/google_places_proxy), set the proxy URL here

#### OAuth/OAuth2 APIs (recommended)

At least one of these providers should be set in order to enable users to log in. Setting a provider involves registering an application with a OAuth/OAuth2 provider, and passing the `client id` and `client secret` tokens to *Find a Conference* through pairs from this set of variables:

* `AMAZON_CLIENT_ID` and `AMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` and `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` and `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `TUMBLR_CLIENT_ID` and `TUMBLR_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `WINDOWS_CLIENT_ID` and `WINDOWS_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `YAHOO_CLIENT_ID` and `YAHOO_CLIENT_SECRET`

#### Debug (optional)

* `DEBUG`: sets if the application is started in debug mode (e.g. `True`)
* `ASSETS_DEBUG`: sets if [webassets](http://webassets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/environment.html?highlight=debug#webassets.env.Environment.debug) runs in debug mode (e.g. `True`)

### Step-by-step installation (without Vagrant)

1. Clone the repository and step in its directory: `$ git clone git@github.com:cuducos/findaconf.git && cd findaconf`
1. If you want, get your [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) running
1. Install the dependencies: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt && bower install` 
1. Set up your [environment variables](#environment-variables): `$ mv .env.sample .env` and then edit `.env` accordingly
1. Create and feed the database: `$ python manage.py db upgrade`
1. Run the server with something like: `$ python manage.py runserver -r -d -h 0.0.0.0`

### Step-by-step installation with Vagrant

The `Vagrant.sh` file is our provision file and it does a lot of the job for you: installs everything your virtual machine might need, creates and migrates the databases, installs project dependencies, and creates the basic environment variables to get the server running.

However you might need to make further changes in the `.env` file, such as setting your API credentials and a safer `SECRET_KEY`.

1. Clone the repository and step in its directory: `$ git clone git@github.com:cuducos/findaconf.git && cd findaconf`
1. Start create, provision and log into your virtual machine: `$ vagrant up && vagrant ssh`
1. Go to the application directory: `$ cd /vagrant`
1. Run the server with something like: `$ python manage.py runserver -r -d -h 0.0.0.0`

### Further installation notes

If you need further instructions to configure your development environment, take a look at our [Vagrant bootstrap script](/Vagrant.sh). It has all the commands to install Python, Node.js, CoffeeScript, Bower and PostgreSQL dependencies, and to create databases and users. It is designed to work with [Ubuntu 14.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/trusty/), but works with most [Debian](http://debian.org) distributions.

We suggest running the server with the optional arguments `-r -d -h 0.0.0.0`. Just in case you are not familiar with them: `-d` enables the debug mode, `-r` reloads the server in case you change any file, and `-h 0.0.0.0` starts the server at this (local) IP.

Note that the included [.bowerrc](/.bowerrc) sets up a customized directory to store Bower files.

## Tests

We're using [Nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org) for testing. You might prefer to use `$ nosetests --rednose` for legibility. 

Nose has serious difficulties in finding tests in executable files, thus if you wanna change the permissions of the tests files just run: `$ chmod -x $(find findaconf/tests/ -name '*.py')`.

## Contributing

You can discuss the project, further features, implementation and report issues [here on GitHub](https://github.com/cuducos/findaconf/issues). And pull requests are very welcomed indeed:

* Fork this repository
* Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
* Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
* Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
* Go to your fork page at GitHub and create new pull request

### To do list

These are the next steps (there is a lot to be done, these are just some more short term tasks):

1. Enhance users login (add fields/features such as `last_seen`, `remember_me`, `created_at`, `created_with`, `last_accessed_with` â€“ these last two fields refer to the OAuth/OAuth2 provider)
1. Redirect users after login
1. Roles for user permissions have not been created (we have the table `Group` created, but we are not using it)
1. Threading for email notifications
1. Create the page to add conferences
1. Add full text search to Conference mapped class (for example, with [Whoosh](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Whoosh))
1. Commands (via Flask-Script or Celery) to update support table (`Keywords`, `MagicNumbers`)
1. Proof read (as most of us are not native English speakers)
1. Terms of use
1. `/support` page explaining the business model, the costs and the  donations through Unlock, PayPal and Bitcoin
1. What else?
